[RODEO: Robust Outlier Detection via Exposing Adaptive Out-of-Distribution Samples](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/mirzaei24a.html)

This repository contains the code and experimental setup for RODEO, a novel approach for robust outlier detection presented at ICML 2024. RODEO introduces an adaptive Outlier Exposure (OE) technique, combining adversarial training and synthetic outliers generated from text-to-image models. This method effectively creates "near-distribution", "diverse" and "contextually analogous" outliers, enhancing the model's performance in both clean and adversarial settings. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in robustness over existing methods, especially against adversarial attacks.
